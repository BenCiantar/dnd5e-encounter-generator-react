<h3>Dungeons and Dragons 5e Encounter Generator - React Version</h3>

Brief: Part two of the individual project for the Hyper Island "First Web App" module. The brief was to refactor the web apps we created in part one into functioning React apps.

Timeframe: Three weeks.

Description: I chose to create a tool for Dungeons and Dragons game masters to easily generate and balance monster encounters for their players by automating the calculation tables included in the rulebook, and incorporating a DnD monster API.

Key Learnings:

    The essentials of React:
    
      Creating both class and functional components.

      Handling states and accessing them across components.
                
      Using hooks to handle events.
    
      Using props to pass data between components.
    
      Developing logical file structure for a fully modular project.
